# OD&D + Chainmail House Rules

This game uses OD&D and Chainmail as basis, but is heavily inspired by Forbidden Lore and The Age of Conan, both supplements provided by [Grey-Elf](http://www.grey-elf.com). 

The game also uses the [Target 20 System](http://www.oedgames.com/target20/) for combat.

Some changes might sounds too off but it stills D&D at it's very core.

The house rules were thought to give life for a game set in The Hyborean Age, and to give the characters a pulp feel, a sword and sorcery game, where the characters must have a little more surviveability or else will be no tales to be told.

In this setting, most of creatures will be human and magical items will be as rare as they are cursed. 

Just a few creatures are mythological monsters or they're powerful sorcerers and necromancers, normally as bosses.

This document focus on the rules to fuel such setting and not on the setting though.

# [1] Character Creation

## Character Classes

Fighter, Magic-User and Cleric.

There is no Thief class because everybody is a Thief in potential.

Think Clerics not as priests but more as a "chosen by god" hero such as Achilles.

## Attributes

3d6 in order, receiving a single "swap" in the end.

| Score | Bonus |
|-----------|-|
| 3-8	| -1|
| 9-12	| 0|
| 13+	| +1|

During character creation:
- A Intelligence of 13+ gives you an additional language;
- A Constitution of 13+ gives you +1 HP for HD.
- A Charisma of 13+ gives you a starting retainer.

This starting retainer rule for a high charisma is because my players keep resisting in hiring retainers, they're modern editions' players and is hard for them to make their heads into hire someone, starting with a retainer is giving good results on them getting used to care of more than one character.

Apart from character creation bonuses:
- The attribute bonuses of +1 or -1 apply on Saving Throw (more on this later); 
- The charisma bonus would apply on Reactions; 
- The +1 constitution would help on recovery at long rest (more about character HP and recovery later).


# [2] Combat, Damage and Save

## Save
The Saving Throw uses 2d6 as in Chainmail.

The base Save is 10+, meaning they need 10 or more on 2d6 to succeed.

Depending on the save (and the situation) the character can receive +1 or -1 by justification on the use of an attribute in a saving throw, if the related attribute is 13+ the roll will be 2d6+1.

Optionally, this can be further increased by adding the character HD, so a Level 1 character will mechanically Save 9+ adding related attribute bonus if any, and a Level 2 character will Save 8+, etc.

This optional rule doesn't translate well for a game lasting long with high level characters, if the game runs for characters up to level 3 or level 5 it will work just nice, but if the campaign lasts for level 8, 10 or more, this HD bonus should stack at HD 5 for balance.

As a Traveller lover, depending on the situation I might ask for a Save of 8+ instead of 10+ if I think they should have a better chance.

I'm also planning to give the characters a Save of 8+ on Level 5 as I'm not using the HD bonus. But I'm still not sure.

## To Hit and Armour
The hit formula uses Target 20 System but using 2d10, meaning 2d10 + HD + AC + bonus >= 20 to hit.

The use of 2d10 is a personal choice that only works well in the said setting. There is not much Plate Mail around, the AC normally ranges from 9 to 5.

The 2d10 draws a triangular probability distribution, meaning that it increases the chance to hit AC from 9 to 7 comparing with a d20, for AC 6 and 5 it is slightly difficult, and AC 2 is close to impossible. Which doesn't affect the said setting where no one will be using AC 2.

Even if someone is using Plate+Shield, it would give AC 3, as the Shield purpose is to Save character from death and doesn't mod AC.

That being said, a Shield would break when a character suffers a fatal blow.

Slight improving the To Hit chance by using 2d10 and AC 9~5 helps to make combat a little faster.

Using a d20 is just alright, but 3d6 could be a good choice for a faster combat as well. I'm using 2d10 for testing and I have no complains by my players, but I'm not sure if it's a better idea than using 3d6.

## Damage

Once a hit score, the character automatically inflict 1 damage.

Then you need to roll 1d6 as a "damage dice", and the character will inflict an extra damage in a result of 6.

Another way of reading this is, in a Hit, roll for damage, a result of 6 inflicts two of damage, otherwise 1 of damage is caused.

This might sound strange, as the damage being so low the battles would supposedly last long.

The Creatures HP are equal to their HD, I usually give +1 HP on 1-in-6 to have some variation for each creature, just for fun, but most of the time HD = Hits to Kill.

What I'm trying to do is to "average everything".

A creature would roll 1d6 for HP as well as characters would roll 1d6 for damage, instead we consider every d6 roll as a mean value of 3.5, thus, "dividing both sides by 3.5", is the same as having 1 point of HP per 1 point of Damage.

I think it's frustrating in a normal game that after the player already struggle a lot to finally hit, it rolls for only 1 point of damage.

In the first levels in a traditional OD&D game, 1 point of damage can be enough to kill something, but normally it will not, the combat will take long to finish and the player might be frustrated if he is a Fighter rolling 1 or 2 of damage when he finally manage to hit.

I had a lot of fun with the traditional combat, years of fun, but also frustration and long combats, I think that we need a faster combat to feel it more like sword and sorcery.

As players still like to roll for damage, I've adopted the Chainmail "damage on a 6" but as an extra damage.

The result is that mathematically a hit would already inflict half the maximum damage, and a roll of 6 in the "damage dice" would result in maximum damage as if rolling a normal damage.

We're having a good time with those fast combats, and it generates some cool adaptations for magic and creatures special attacks. A 3rd level Magic-User casting a Lightning Bolt spell would inflict 1 damage + 3d6, each 6 results increasing the damage in +1. The players are always feeling some nice tension about the numbers to be rolled, hunting those "extra 6's" in the results.

My players aren't kids, they're Engineers, Chemists and Lawyers, but I would assume that this is a great system to use with kids as well since they don't have to do much Math, they will only count how many dices are facing 6's up.

A hit on a natural 20 would already inflict maximum damage, no need to roll for a 6 on the damage dice, the players liked this when we were still using d20, but on 2d20 a "natural 20" have only a 1% chance so it's rare.

## Weapons

All weapons inflict 1d6 damage where damage works as noted above.

Every class can use any weapon and armour, no limitations, except that using Plate prevents the Magic-User from casting while using it.

**One-handed Weapon**: allows the character to use a shield or hold a torch in combat.

**Two-handed Weapon**: extra damage occurs in a roll of 5 or 6 instead of only at 6, just like a "heavier figure" would in Chainmail (Appendix A).

**Two Weapons**: offers a +1 to hit.

On using two weapons, Forbidden Lore discuss that a figure using two handaxes would defend as a heavy foot and attack as a light foot, but I decided that giving modifiers to AC would defy the purpose of using 2d10 to keep the optimal AC range already discussed, so I'm improving the hit chance instead.

## Fatal Blow and Moral

As discussed, on a Fatal Blow the character shield will break to save the character's life.

If the character is using no shield, or after the shield break, the character need to succeed on a Save to avoid death.

The Save against Death is a 10+ with only a possible modifier by Con.

I prefer to keep the Save against Death as a 10+ without using the optional rule of adding character HD as modifier.

This Save should not be easy, it's just for the players to have a bit more chance of surviving (for the pulp sake) and for then to have a little more emotion and hope that their character might survive.

If the characters are Level 5 with the 8+ Save base, the Save against Death might use the 8+ base instead.

Failing the Save will put the characters with zero HP which probably means death, unless I think about something nice, like making them slaves or something, in our last game they were breaking free from a Kushite Slave Ship (The Pit of Kutallu adventure adapted from 2d20).

Creatures roll for Moral as normal. Additional info on Section 5.

## Health Points and Recovery

Every player character starts the game with 1d6 HP.

This can be adjusted by +1 Con.

This may sounds too much considering that creatures have HD = HP, but most of the time, the characters are facing multiple foes and the idea is to emulate the novels and comics where Conan and his friends prevail against weak foes with easy, but struggle agains some huge ones.

The idea is to have fast combats, even the characters having more initial HP than most foes they don't feel like it, specially when they kill foes with one or two blows, they think that they might die in one blow as well.

Although they have a potential higher HP initially, they can only recover 1 HP per rest, there is no healing magic or healing potions, and not every "sleep" is a rest, they have to be in a place where they can indeed have a nice and refreshing rest, at least a campfire and a meal before rest.

Everytime they level up, they can roll their HD+Con, if the new result is greater than their actual HP, it will be their new Max HP.

Personally I like this because the players have a little more survivability, and I can put some traps around without fearing too much hit-kills. A trap might inflict one damage (or two if the damage dice roll a six), so it will hurt but not necessarily kill as easy as in by the book OD&D.

I like that they can fall in a trap and survive to tell, and I like that I can put some more traps around without fearing that they will die too fast.

## Reaction, Surprise and Initiative

I don't roll for initiative. The characters almost always start first and then we take turns.

Everytime an encouter occurs, I roll for Reaction.

If the result is Hostile, the creature might attack first, and then we take turns.

The attack depends of the creature intelligence and the current situation. 

A panther will always be faster than the characters so it will always attack first in a Hostile reaction.

# [3] Equipment

We all like the encumbrance system, we were using it until before pandemics.

Now we're testing something easier, since almost everything by using "Chainmail" got simpler, why keep the encumbrance Math?

Every character can carry 6 items (1d6), not counting their clothes.

If the character is carrying a bag or backpack, he can carry 11 items (2d6).

A horse or mule would carry 16 items (3d6).

This system serves the purpose of simplifying the Equipment and adding some mechanic tension.

Lets say the character Equipment is like:

- [1] Longsword
- [2] Shield
- [3] Leather
- [4] Lantern
- [5] Rope
- [6] (empty)

If a trap spring from the ceiling dropping some Acid in a character that failed a Saving Throw, instead of hurting him (or killing), I would roll 1d6, in a result of 1 I would say that his longsword is no more, the character lost it for the trap.

Or lets say an arrow was shot into a backpack, maybe the arrow hit a flask, empty or not, and the flask is now broken.

Sometimes the character might suffer damage AND lose the item.

My players liked it so far.

A Leather ocuppy 1 slot, Chainmail 2 slots and Plate will take 3 slots.

I let players group small itens in the same slot, some players started to write it as kits, like a spellbook, a quill and ink flask the Fighter wrote "Kit for taking notes".

# [4] Character Classes

We always used OD&D or Basic rules for character classes (normally race-as-class), but this time I've wrote some house rules.

As we reboot our campaign recently, I only wrote the Level 1 of each class as they didn't leveled yet.

## Fighter

- Can make a second attack if attacked creature died this turn.
- Receive +1 to hit and damage if STR 13+. (A extra damage will be 5-6 instead o 6, or 4-6 instead of 5-6 using Two-handed Weapon)
- If unencumbered (not carrying more than 6 items) enables Leap of 25 feat or more. (This one from AS&SH)

## Magic-User

- Can use "Cantrips" (Prestidigitation) without in-game mechanic advantage.
- - For a Cantrip to generate a mechanic advantage must Save 10+.
- Can't cast using Plate.
- To learn new Spells need to be teached, find relics or steal from other sorcerers.
- Can cast 2 spells per HD per day.
- Can spend 1+ HP to:
- - Cast an additional magic after the magics per day run out. Spend x HP to cast a x-th level spell.
- - Cast a spell greater than what the character would be able. (Details below)
- Starts the game knowing 2 Spells, +1 if INT 13+.

The idea is to give a feel of sword and sorcery novels like Conan and Fafhrd and Gray Mouser.

Magic is something obscure and dangerous. I remember Gray Mouser almost dying trying to curse a Duke, and almost all Magic-Users on Conan are Dark Sorcerers or Necromancers.

My idea is that Magic is using blood, making pacts and giving away the soul. My players like it but I can see why some people might not.

That's why I like the idea of characters using their blood to power spells or sacrificing themselves to go beyond their body limit.

I've saw multiple times Magic-User (or "Wizards") using their dayly spells and then getting bored for a while or complaining about taking rest as soon as possible. Now they can go beyond their limits or even sacrifice their characters in a last resort spell to save the group.

Considering that the character might found a magic of 2nd or 3rd level being a 1st level Magic-User, I like the idea for the character to burn some health to be able to use the spell before he become strong enought to "tame" it.

The source of the Magic-User don't need to be a spellbook, the player can choose that it is a wand, a scepter, pacts or something else, when the spells per day run out is because the character is exaust, he also don't need to "prepare" the spell, the character can cast any spell he knows/have whenever he want/can.

## Cleric

- Receive Save +1 against opposite alignment and those creatures attacks the Cleric with -1.
- Sense Evil 60ft. (Think as the gods whispering on the heroes ear on Iliad)
- You're favoured by the gods:
- - Once per HD per day, choose: Immune to Fear, Word of Courage, Endure, Turn Undead.

**Immune to Fear**: Magical fear don't affect the Cleric today.

**Word of Courage**: The Cleric gives a speech inspired by the gods, every fellow recover 1 HP.

**Endure**: The Cleric have an additional chance of surviving Death or Venon on a 10+ (no modifiers allowed).

**Turn Undead**: Cause fear to 2d6 creatures of HD equal or less than Cleric's HD.
If attacked, the creatures will not fear anymore and will defend.
The creatures can't get closer than 10ft as if the Cleric was in a Sanctuary.
A HD 5 Cleric will instead destroy HD 1 creatures.

As I've said, my Cleric is pretty much Achilles. 

Think of it more as a Paladin than a Priest if you like.

I've kept Turn Undead because that's a classic, but Clerics can't insta-destroy Undeads more than of HD 1, and they can't turn creatures with HD greater than the Cleric HD.

The Cleric doesn't need to choose the favour in the beginning of a day, he can use it whenever he want, so after failing a Save for Death, he can use *Endure* if he have favours left.

## Elves

The only "non-human" class I'm working on, but they're not being used yet, and might not be.

There are mentions of "Elves" and other creatures on Conan novels but more as a myth, Howard passed away before writing more about other continents and creatures so we don't know for sure.

It was not tested, only reasoned about.

It could be used as Hyperboreans instead.

- Infravision. (Isn't darkvision)
- Receives +1 in Hit and Damage if STR 13+.
- Leap if unencumbered.
- Can cast 1 spell per hd per day but can't use blood on them.
- Can sense Secret Doors passively on 1-in-6 and can find them on 4-in-6.
- Base Save of 8+.

The same idea of Basic were they was Fighter/Magic-User from beginning but progress slower. I've nerfed them a bit though, they're not as good at magic as a Magic-User. In this moment I think in an Elf like Deedlit, would not use immaculate magic (powered by blood).

If used as Hyperboreans though they should be as good or better at magic than Magic-Users.
